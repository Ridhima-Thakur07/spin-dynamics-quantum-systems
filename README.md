# Spin Dynamics in Quantum Systems

## Overview
This project focuses on the simulation and analysis of spin dynamics in quantum systems.
It is based on fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics studied as part of the academic curriculum.

## Objectives
- To understand the behaviour of quantum spin systems
- To implement simulation logic for spin dynamics
- To analyze results obtained from computational models

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C / Python
- Core Concepts: Quantum Mechanics, Spin Dynamics, Numerical Methods

## My Contribution
My primary contribution to this project was in the **coding and implementation**, which included:
- Writing and debugging the simulation code
- Implementing computational logic related to spin dynamics
- Assisting in verification and refinement of results


## How to Run
1. Open the `code` folder  
2. Compile or run the program depending on the language used  

## Academic Note
This repository is created for academic and learning purposes.
External tools were used only for assistance in understanding concepts and debugging code,
while all implementation decisions and results were independently verified.
